&quot; **API in minutes&quot;****!! **_** Doesn&#39;t it sound amazing?**_

**DrawPI** aims to bring this amazing work in frame through this Website.

[Drawpi.com](https://drawpi.com/) is a website that lets you build, and host a custom, back-end without coding.

To begin with, the first and foremost step is to create a screen in which you can build,work and explore the creative section of APIs. The steps are easy and fluent to undertake.

## So lets start!!!

First you need to sign in to the website to get acquainted with your dashboard where you will find the options, to access, on the left . Clicking on &#39; **Create&#39;** option will take you to a Project Screen that will refer to a backend.

The project dialog box that appears on screen will work forward by clicking on **&#39;+Create&#39;** option which will start hosting your backend live with your username (eg. - projectname.drawpi.com). Name your Project.

[Note: **API backend** is a way for developers to link their software and application to cloud-based storage, making it easier to link up with software development kits and **APIs**]

Now it&#39;s time to create collections that will organise your endpoints and keep them structured, it is required to have at least one collection in card. You are again required to give a nice name to your collections.

After completing these processes you will be directed to a screen to create a DB schema. Users can simply create multiple schemas and by default the primary key is auto incremented, therefore,there is no need of incrementing using other API.

The datatypes DrawPI support till now is **int** and **varchar** with maximum 255 chars.

And it&#39;s done,you have created your DB schema to build further APIs.

On the left of your dashboard you will find a section of details in which the method and URL is to be chosen . The by default method is **GET.** Name the endpoint that you desire to be live on API.

SCHEMA SCREEN

While proceeding further you will find some more blocks of DrawPI that includes:

**Response** : It is a temporary variable that can be used in further condition

**Add Condition** : It allows you to add and object request /response to the module.

**Replace Condition** : Allows to replace attributes in response to value

**Update Condition** : Allows to update attribute in response by operator value

**Response Delete condition** : Allows you to delete entries.

The steps mentioned above will take you to the creation of your screen. Didn&#39;t you find some great strategies that are being performed here?

But in the meantime, here&#39;s a tip you can use right away. You can go to the website [https://drawpi.com](https://drawpi.com/) ,sign in to the dashboard and try making your own screen:

Go look at your DB schema now.

Take out every word that doesn&#39;t contribute something new.

Come back here and tell us about the before-and-after. I bet you&#39;ll have something to say!
