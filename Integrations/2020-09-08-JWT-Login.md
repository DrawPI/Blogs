### JWT Login

The main authentication middleware in DrawPI, irrespective of most authentication strategies, is based on JSON Web Tokens.

Let's say you have added a basic login authentication strategy.

2 routes are created: 
- /jwt/signup - Where a new user can sign up and have their credentials saved in the Database. The default is saving the email and password.
- /jwt/login - Where the user can login and receive a JWT (JSON Web Token) for his/her authentication.

The returned JWT can then be used as an authorization bearer token for future protected requests.

### Underlying Code

We use passport strategies to complete this login.
The code assumes that you have a `users` table created with field names: `email` and `password`.

Everytime you send a login request, the API returns a JWT token encoding the entire user object.

Everytime you send a request to a protected route, that token is decoded and the user's authenticity is verified by the `id` in your database.
