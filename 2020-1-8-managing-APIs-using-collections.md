Well, managing APIs turns out not to be very
easy when you have a lots of endpoints.

And it
is very important to group and organize these
end points.
You can use collections to power
various parts of your API development, testing, and publishing workflows.

Collections enable
you to group API proxies, targets, or developer
apps and set up appropriate threshold values
for all members of the group to diagnose
issues faster.

Collections are just like modules in a project
which holds end points of a category. It is your
choice to either create all endpoints in one
collection or separate them over different
collections. Collections are easily created by
clicking on the +create button on the top right
corner of the collection card. You should
atleast select one condition to continue.
