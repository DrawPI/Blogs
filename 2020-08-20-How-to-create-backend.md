While we have tried our best to make the process intuitive for both developers and non-developers alike, we understand that there might be certain confusions and the need for a guide/doc may arise.

Here are the best recommended links:  
1. [A short tutorial on building, deploying an API on DrawPI](https://drawpi.com/blogs/DrawPI---Building-API-in-minutes-21)
2. [A complete guide to the DrawPI platform](https://guide.drawpi.com).
