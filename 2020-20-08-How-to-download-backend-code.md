## Download the Backend Code

What?! The DrawPI platform isn't enough for your API anymore? You need to add more complex functionalities using custom code?
Sure, we understand. 

Great developers deserve to code greatness, not the trivial `app.get(){...}` and simple DB queries.

Once you have built an API that you want to build on locally without the DrawPI platform, you can download the generated code from the DrawPI servers into your own PC.

Go to the [Manage Section](https://drawpi.com/dashboard/manage), and select the Project whose code you want to download. A dropdown will expand below the selected project in the left Sidebar. Click on **Download**.
That's it. You have the entire project code with you. 
Replace the DB_URI and Database names with your own local/hosted Database properties.
