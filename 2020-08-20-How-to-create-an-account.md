## Getting Started

There are 2 ways to get into the DrawPI Platform: Basic Email,and Github Sign Up.

### Github Sign Up/In

If you have a Github account, this is the best and easiest way to login. Simply click on the Github Sign In button, and you'll be in the platform without any hassle.
Doesn't matter if you're signing in for the first time, or coming back, it's the same way.

> **Warning**: Your Github account has an email address associated with it. We use this email address and your GH username to identify you. This will be your only way to Sign In to DrawPI, and you cannot use this email to Sign Up to DrawPI manually later.

### Basic Email

The simple, traditional way of signing up, Email Sign Up has its own perks.

If you choose to Sign Up using Email, Password and your own username, we save your unique data and send a _confirmation-cum-welcome e-mail_ to you.
This e-mail contains a concise explanation of what you can do in DrawPI and how you can get started.

> **Important**: Opening this email is extremely important as it contains a link to Activate your Account. Going to this link enables you to login which you will not be able to do otherwise.
