Trying to create a project in DrawPI and you have no idea what to do?  

So, when you want to create a backend project in Drawpi, firstly you need to tap on the **+Create** button and then you are asked to enter the project name. Enter the project name using first character from _a-z_ then, you can use either _a-z_ or _0-9_.  

Once the project is created it is live on https:// \<username>-\<projectname>.drawpi.com . After the project is created, you have to select a project to move over to the collection card. Atleast one project should be selected to continue.
